# Guess the Flag

**Guess the Flag** is a fun SwiftUI-based quiz app where players identify country flags from a selection. Built as part of the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) by Paul Hudson, this project introduces and reinforces fundamental SwiftUI concepts, including Stack layouts, Gradients, Buttons, and Alerts.

## Overview

The app features:

- **Randomized Flags**: A shuffled set of flags to choose from each round.
- **Score Tracking**: Gain or lose points based on correct or incorrect answers.
- **Game Limits**: The game resets after 8 rounds.
- **Feedback Alerts**: Alerts display feedback and scores after each attempt.

## Key Concepts and Code Examples

### 1. **Stacks for Layout**

SwiftUI `VStack` and `ZStack` are used to create the main layout, layering elements for structure and background.

```swift
ZStack {
  RadialGradient(stops: [
    .init(color: Color(red: 0.1, green: 0.2, blue: 0.45), location: 0.3),
    .init(color: Color(red: 0.76, green: 0.15, blue: 0.26), location: 0.3)
  ], center: .top, startRadius: 200, endRadius: 700)
  .ignoresSafeArea()
  
  VStack {
    Text("Guess the Flag")
      .font(.largeTitle.bold())
      .foregroundStyle(.white)
    // Game content
  }
}
```

### 2. **Gradients for Backgrounds**

A `RadialGradient` is applied as a background to create a visually appealing effect.

```swift
RadialGradient(
  stops: [
    .init(color: Color(red: 0.1, green: 0.2, blue: 0.45), location: 0.3),
    .init(color: Color(red: 0.76, green: 0.15, blue: 0.26), location: 0.3)
  ],
  center: .top,
  startRadius: 200,
  endRadius: 700
)
```

### 3. **Buttons with Action and Labels**

Each flag is presented as a button, and selecting a flag triggers the `flagTapped` function.

```swift
Button {
  flagTapped(number)
} label: {
  Image(countries[number])
    .clipShape(.capsule)
    .shadow(radius: 5.0)
}
```

### 4. **Alerts for User Feedback**

Alerts provide feedback on each selection, including whether the answer was correct, the correct flag when an incorrect choice is made, and a game-over message.

```swift
.alert(scoreTitle, isPresented: $showingScore) {
  Button(gameAttempts == 7 ? "Play Again" : "Continue", action: askQuestion)
} message: {
  Text(scoreMessage)
}
```

1. The app shows three random flags, and the player must tap the correct one.
2. Each correct answer awards points, while incorrect selections deduct points.
3. Alerts show feedback on each answer, and the game resets after 8 rounds.
